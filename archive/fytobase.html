                This website aims to be a resource for understanding the phytochemicals (non-nutrient constituents) in regular foods. These molecules can:

                This website is a work in progress. The following images describe the design problems I am working through.

                Note that the relationships would be best suited to a bidirectional lookup/analysis. For example, a user may wish to query all vegetables with phytochemical X, or they may wish to query all phytochemicals in vegetable Y.
                The database must be easy to:

                    <li>Extract conclusions from data easily once the database has been sufficiently established</li>
                    <li>Future-proofed, easy to back up and transferrable in the event of a better suited database environment</li>
